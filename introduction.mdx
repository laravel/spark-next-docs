Laravel Spark is the perfect starting point for your next big idea. When combined with a Laravel application starter kit like [Laravel Jetstream](https://jetstream.laravel.com) or [Laravel Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/starter-kits), or the frontend of your choice, Spark provides a well-designed billing management panel for your application. Spark, which is built on the power of [Laravel Cashier](https://laravel.com/docs/billing), allows your customers to subscribe to monthly or yearly billing plans, manage their payment method, update their subscription plans, and download their invoices all from a self-contained, beautifully designed billing portal.

## Supported Payment Providers

Spark supports two payment providers, and purchasing a Spark license grants you the ability to use either of these payment providers. **At this time, it is not possible to implement your own custom payment provider when using Spark.** We'll provide a brief overview of each provider below.

### Paddle

[Paddle](https://paddle.com) is a robust billing provider that serves as a merchant of record for your application. Paddle removes the burden of tax compliance from your SaaS business by handling the complexity of gathering and paying your VAT for you. In addition, Paddle provides support for accepting payments from your customers via credit card or PayPal, localized pricing, and hosted invoices.

Spark's Paddle support is provided by the underlying [Laravel Cashier Paddle](https://laravel.com/docs/cashier-paddle) library.

<Warning>
    Your Paddle account must be approved by Paddle before you can begin using Spark. To apply for an account, please visit the [Paddle website](https://paddle.com). **While you are developing your application, you may use the [Paddle Sandbox](https://sandbox-vendors.paddle.com/)**.
</Warning>

### Stripe

[Stripe](https://stripe.com) is a global leader in payment infrastructure with direct integration with card networks and banks, a fast-improving platform, and battle-tested reliability. In addition, intelligent optimizations help increase revenue across conversion, prevent fraud, and assist with revenue recovery. Finally, Stripe provides a robust sandbox environment for you to test your application's payment system.

Spark's Stripe support is provided by the underlying [Laravel Cashier Stripe](https://laravel.com/docs/billing) library.
