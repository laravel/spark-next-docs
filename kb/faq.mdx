## Is it possible to upgrade an application from Spark Classic to Spark?

No. However, we will continue to provide bug fixes and security updates to Spark Classic indefinitely.

## Can I sell Spark powered applications?

You may not sell Spark powered applications on code distribution platforms such as Code Canyon, etc. However, if you build a SaaS application / business which is later acquired by a private third-party, you may transfer your Spark license to that buyer.

## Does Spark support any other payment providers?

No. Spark only supports Stripe and Paddle and it is not possible for developers to customize Spark to accept additional providers. If you need to use another payment provider **you should not purchase Laravel Spark**.

## Am I required to use Tailwind / Blade / Vue / etc. in order to use Spark?
No. Spark's billing portal is totally isolated from the rest of your Laravel application and includes its own pre-compiled frontend assets. Your own application may be built using the frontend technologies of your choice.

## Why are my customers presented with a payment confirmation screen?

Extra verification is sometimes required in order to confirm and process a payment. When this happens, Paddle or Stripe will present a payment confirmation screen. Payment confirmation screens presented by Paddle, Stripe, or Spark may be tailored to a specific bank or card issuer's payment flow and can include additional card confirmation, a temporary small charge, separate device authentication, or other forms of verification.
