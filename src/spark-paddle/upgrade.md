# Upgrade

## Upgrading to Spark (Paddle) 5.0 from 4.x

Unfortunately there is no official upgrade path guidance from Paddle to migrate from Paddle Classic to Paddle Billing. Therefore, if you use Paddle Classic, you should continue to use Spark Paddle 4.x. New projects on Paddle which use Paddle Billing should use Spark Paddle 5.x.
